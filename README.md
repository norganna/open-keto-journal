# open-keto-journal

An open-source journal for people embarking on the Ketonic diets who want assistance with and to track their macronutrient consumption and progress through the journey.

Incorporates data from [Open Food Facts](http://openfoodfacts.org) database, which is licensed under the [ODbL 1.0](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/).

## Why open source

The ketogenic "diet" has changed my life, and I want to make it as easy as possible for my friends, family, neighbours, strangers and the whole world to adopt this lifestyle.

In order to do this, I need to make this application easy to use, free (as in beer) and as unobtrusive as possible (no ads).

In order to do that, I need help building, improving and maintaining the code base to produce the best site possible and give people the best chance possible to succeed in making the transition to a keto adapted existence.

## Contributing

If you have any ideas how to make the application better, please create a feature request ticket in the issues section requesting approval / discussing how to implement your feature.

Once the issue has been marked with the `Approved` label, you or someone else (if you don't have the know-how / capability) can nab the issue, implement the change in a fork and make a pull request (referencing the original issue) to pull the feature back into the master branch (merge requests not referencing an approved issue will be summarily rejected).

## Build Setup

This application is based off VueJS, element and mint-ui. In order to get started, please clone the code base and run the following commands to generate a working development version of the site.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
